4. **Configure `.env`**

    Set database credentials, app key, etc. For example:

    ```text

    APP_ENV=local
    APP_KEY=base64:...  
    APP_URL=http://localhost
    
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql

## üì¶ Usage

- Use the UI to navigate through drivers, teams, seasons, etc.  
- Use the API endpoints (e.g. `/api/drivers`, `/api/teams`) to fetch data programmatically.  
- Integrate with a mobile app or third-party service if needed.  

*(Add example requests/responses if you have them.)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

If your app supports configuration (filters, external APIs, etc.), document them here.  

For example:

```text
API_RATE_LIMIT=100
EXTERNAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
